<p>All generated files are formatted as two dimensional tables. The rows
correspond to a subject activity such as an IQ test or a Switch task
problem, and the columns list data for the activity. This section
describes the parameters that appear in the table columns.</p>
<p>The parameter definitions are described in the following subsections:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Parameters that are defined for many (even all) generated files, and
parameters that are specific to the following activities:<ul>
<li>The BOMAT and Sandia IQ tests</li>
<li>The Inhibit and Switch EF tasks</li>
<li>The Silo Detection, Thumbprint Detection and Visual Search Active
Control training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parameters that are specific to the Rotation Span EF task</li>
<li>Parameters that are specific to RobotFactory training</li>
<li>Parameters that are specific to the questionnaires</li>
<li>Parameters that are specific to the EEG files: the blinded EEG data
files and the generated <em>eeg-sum</em> file</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless noted otherwise, the time units for values extracted from
Presentation log files are expressed in units of 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a
millisecond (Presentation time).</p>

<p>The EEG data files and the stimulation files are generated by the
Neuroelectrics NIC application. The EEG data is recorded at 500 Hz and
the stimulation data is recorded at 1000 Hz. The stimulation file is
only generated for cases when a subject is being stimulated with tES,
including the sham conditions. The EEG data files and stimulation files
are posted as parser output although they are really created by the NIC.</p>
<p>For each EEG file, the NIC also generates an information file (.info
file suffix) which the parser uses for populating parameters in the
generated eeg-info file.</p>
<p>The NIC does not reliably generate .stim and .info files. We have
instances where one or the other file is missing.</p>
<div class="section" id="eeg-data-files">
<h3>EEG Data Files<a class="headerlink" href="#eeg-data-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The parser modifies the .easy file generated by the parser in these two
ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Normalizes and blinds the file name</li>
<li>Adds a column heading row to the EEG data file</li>
</ol>
<p>The .easy file name generated by the NIC should have this format:</p>
<p>&lt;timestamp&gt;&lt;subject-id&gt;&lt;qualifier&gt;.easy</p>
<p>The NIC generates the timestamp but the &lt;subject-id&gt; and &lt;qualifier&gt;
parts are entered by the experimenter and mistakes (including typos)
occur about 5% of the time. The &lt;qualifier&gt; provides an indication of
what the subject was doing during the recording (pretest, training,
eyes-open, eyes-closed, etc.).</p>
<p>After correcting errors in the &lt;subject-id&gt; and &lt;qualifier&gt;, the parser
generates this normalized file name for the EEG data file:</p>
<p>&lt;subject-id&gt;&lt;timestamp&gt;&lt;qualifier&gt;.easy</p>
<p>Because EEG analysis started when many of the analysts were blinded, we
actually write the EEG data with blinded file names having this format:</p>
<p>&lt;blinded-id&gt;&lt;seq-number&gt;&lt;qualifier&gt;.easy</p>
<p>The &lt;blinded-id&gt; is a randomly selected integer that uniquely identifies
the subject, and the &lt;seq-number&gt; replaces the timestamp in a manner
that preserves numerical ordering. That is, if</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>timestamp:sub:`1`</em> &lt; <em>timestamp:sub:`2`</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Then the corresponding sequence numbers will also follow this relation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>seqnumber:sub:`1`</em> &lt; <em>seqnumber:sub:`2`</em></div></blockquote>
<p>The EEG-sum file shows all three names for each EEG file, the original
name provided by the NIC, the normalized file name (which we don’t use),
and the blinded file name which we use for naming the exported EEG data
files.</p>
<p>When there is a stimulation file corresponding to an EEG data file, we
write that file with the same name as the EEG data file but with a .stim
file extension:</p>
<p>&lt;blinded-id&gt;&lt;seq-number&gt;&lt;qualifier&gt;.stim</p>
<p>These are the file qualifiers used for naming the blinded files:</p>

<h1>Parser File “rf-triggers”<a class="headerlink" href="#parser-file-rf-triggers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The generated “rf-triggers” file provides linkage for a RobotFactory
trigger value found in an EEG data file back to the game play
information in a parser generated “robotfactory” file. The “rf-triggers”
file is intended to be used with a specific Matlab utility and is not
likely to be useful outside the context of that utility.</p>
<p>For a training session, RobotFactory creates an “output_log” file and
an “LSL_Testing” file while also sending trigger values for the NIC to
merge into the EEG stream. The “output_log” file contains much of the
information provided in the parser generated “robotfactory” files. The
“LSL_Testing” file contains the trigger values sent to the NIC along
with timestamps and other information relating to the trigger. The
generated “rf-triggers” file contains much of the information in the
“LSL_Testing” file.</p>
<p>The TrialID column was added to the generated “robotfactory” file to
support this capability. It simply numbers the lines in the file.</p>
<div class="section" id="contents-of-the-rf-triggers-file">
<h2>Contents of the “rf-triggers” File<a class="headerlink" href="#contents-of-the-rf-triggers-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The parser builds a line in the “rf-triggers” file for each
“LSL_Testing” file. Consequently a line spans an entire training
session (and so can be very long – remember that this file is intended
to be used by another tool).</p>
<p>The line begins with an approximation for the blinded EEG file name for
the training session. The name is approximate because typically there is
more than one EEG file and because, given the timestamp in the
RobtFactory output_log file, the parser can at best infer an
approximate time for the EEG data file. To emphasize that the file name
is approximate, it is prefixed by ‘$’.</p>
<p>So the intent is to have another (and yet to be implemented)
semi-automated utility that, given the approximate file name could scan
the generated “eeg-sum” file and generate a list of likely EEG data
files for the training session. It seems prudent for someone to check
the generated list.</p>
<p>Following the approximate EEG file name, the line contains a 4-tuple for
each trigger sent to the NIC. The 4-tuple contains these values:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A label that describes the purpose of the trigger (e.g.,
begin_shift, begin_trial, begin_stimulus,
stimulus_begins_exiting)</li>
<li>The trigger value, a 32 bit value where the high order bit is always
set (to distinguish from triggers not generated by RobotFactory which
never have the high order bit set)</li>
<li>A trial id that identifies the row in the “robotfactory” collection
of files that corresponds to the trial that contains this trigger, or
a negative number which denotes the following cases:<ul>
<li>-1: the trigger is outside the bounds of a trial (before first
trial, after last trial, between trials)</li>
<li>-2: there is a corresponding output_log file, but it does not
contain any shifts</li>
<li>-3: the output_log file does not contain this shift</li>
<li>-4: the output_log does not contain this trial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A timestamp for the trigger</li>
</ul>
